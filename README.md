# cGames
Use C language to implement various classic games, including greedy snake/Tetris/gobang/minesweeper, etc.

Although python/java languages are emerging in an endless stream and various graphics libraries are dazzling, games implemented in pure C do have a special flavor, because the combination of black and white interface and various characters will evoke the memories of every programmer.
